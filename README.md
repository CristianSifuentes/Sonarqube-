## Key Features

1. **Static Code Analysis**:  
   - Scans source code to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
2. **Multi-Language Support**:  
   - Supports 30+ programming languages, including C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, and more.
3. **Quality Gates**:  
   - Defines criteria to enforce code quality standards during builds.
4. **Security Vulnerability Detection**:  
   - Identifies potential security risks based on OWASP and CWE guidelines.
5. **Code Duplication Detection**:  
   - Highlights duplicate code blocks to enhance maintainability.
6. **Integration with CI/CD**:  
   - Works with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and other CI/CD tools.
7. **Visualization and Dashboards**:  
   - Provides detailed reports and dashboards for tracking quality trends.
8. **Extendable with Plugins**:  
   - Enhances functionality with community and commercial plugins.
